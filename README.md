# Medical Insurance Cost
Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using XGBR r2 
Problem Statement:
Different persons have different body types and different living culture. So, the diseases affection on them or the treatment expense for them also vary with respect to these situations. 
For example, medical insurance premium of a smoker person may require more amount than a normal person without any bad habits, since the probability of occurrence of chronic disease are more for smokers. 
The main aim of this application is to help users to get overall idea about the appropriate medical insurance premium suitable for their living culture, gender and age.
About the model:
The application has designed in such a way that we can do predictions using 5 Machine Learning model. We can get the insurance premium prediction based on providing input features from uploading the csv file and model will give the predictions as a csv file .Main features are Age, sex, body mass index, children, smoker or not, region.
Dataset:
This includes a dataset representing insurance costs for individuals. It uses information such as age, sex, bmi, and smoking habits to determine the cost on the insurance company for that person.
The idea is to present a machine learning model that predicts the cost with the highest accuracy.
The code in this repository is in Python (primarily using jupyter notebooks) unless otherwise stated.
